    <h2>House Danceëž€</h2>
    <p>The main elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dance" target="_blank" title="about house dance">House dance include</a> "jacking", "footwork",
    and "lofting".[3] The element of "jacking", or the "jack",
    an ecstatic, sex-driven rippling movement of the torso
    is the most famous dance move associated with early house music.
    [4][5] It has found its way onto numerous record titles like the
    Jack Trax EP by Chip E. (1985), "Jack'n the House" (1985) by Farley
    "Jackmaster" Funk (1985), "Jack Your Body" by Steve "Silk" Hurley (1986),
     or "Jack to the Sound of the Underground" by Fast Eddie (1988).<img src="sky.jpg" width="100%"></p>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">House dance is often improvised and emphasizes fast
      and complex
    foot-oriented steps combined with fluid movements in the torso,
    as well as floor work. There is an emphasis on the subtle rhythms
     and riffs of the music, and the footwork follows them closely.
